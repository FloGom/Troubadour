### 2. Control the audio volume

With `^`and `v` buttons you can increase or decrease the volume. Be sure to have the `vol`script installed.   
See [vol_install.md](vol_install.md) for more details.   
The screen go black for less than a second each time these buttons are pressed, it's normal. 
The script is quiet slow to change the volume.
